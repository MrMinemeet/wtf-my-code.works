This repository contains the source code for my personal website: https://wtf-my-code.works  
It is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries.

One of my goals with this website is to keep it as simple and lightweight as possible, while still being visually appealing and user-friendly.
Lightweight in my context means, that the website should load quickly (by avoiding unnecessary resources), and it should keep most of its functionality even when JavaScript is disabled.

**Important:** Changes to this repository will **not** be automatically deployed to the live website. For instant updates, please visit my [GitHub Pages](https://mrminemeet.github.io/wtf-my-code.works/) version of the site.
