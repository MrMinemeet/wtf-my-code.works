			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a software engineer driven by passion for programming and constant curiosity to learn. Beyond
				coding, I enjoy the challenge of strategy games. Furthermore, I like to experiment in the kitchen and
				try out new recipes. When I'm not coding or cooking, I enjoy spending time with friends and family.
			</p>
			<p>
				My technical path started at <a href="https://htl-braunau.at/" target="_blank">HTL-Braunau</a>, where I
				focused on Electronics with a specialization on <em>Mobile Computing & Software Engineering</em>. This
				sparked my interest and led me to pursue a <em>Computer Science</em> Bachelor's degree at <a
					href="https://jku.at" target="_blank">JKU</a>. While studying, I enjoyed sharing some knowledge by
				working as a tutor for the <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/" target="_blank">Institute of System
					Software</a> (SSW) for six semesters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Somewhat recently, I finished my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in
				<em>Software Engineering</em> at JKU. During my studies I had the opportunity to work as a part-time
				Software Engineer at <a href="https://dynatrace.com" target="_blank">Dynatrace</a>, where I contributed
				to the <em>OneAgent Node.js</em> team. My Master's thesis, "<em>A Generic Machine Code Instrumentation
					Library</em>", is a challenging project I'm undertaking in collaboration with both the SSW and
				Dynatrace.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the educational steps done, I continue to work in the OneAgent Node.js team at Dynatrace in a
				full-time position. My focus is on enhancing the Node.js OneAgent by adding new features, as well as
				improving and maintaing the existing agent.

				<h3>Computer Science Master</h3>
				<p>JKU Linz</p>
				<p>February 2024 - July 2025</p>
				<p>
					The main focus is on my Master's thesis about creating "<em>A Generic Machine Code Instrumentation
						Library</em>". This project is a collaboration between the <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/"
						target="_blank">Institute for System Software</a> and <a href="https://dynatrace.com"
						target="_blank">Dynatrace</a>. In contrast to other tools which only support certain
					architectures or operating systems, this library aims to be written in a modular way, such that
					multi-architecture and multi-operating system support can be achieved.<br>
					The written thesis is available on <a
						href="assets/files/university/A_Generic_Machine_Code_Instrumentation_Library.pdf"
						target="_blank">here</a>.

				<h3>Computer Science Bachelor</h3>
				<p>JKU Linz</p>
				<p>October 2020 - January 2024</p>
				<p>
					The adventure of my studies then started at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz with the
					Bachlor's program in Computer Science. There I got a broader understanding of the field of computer
					science. I learned about various concepts, algorithms, and programming languages. I also got a
					deeper understanding of the software development process and the importance of testing and
					debugging.<br>
					One of the highlights was the "Compiler Construction" course, where the task is to create a compiler
					in Java for the <em>MicroJava</em> language. This was a challenging but also rewarding experience,
					when I saw the first program running and all the components working together nicely (and also seeing
					all tests pass was a great feeling).<br>
					Related to this course, I wrote my Bachelor's thesis at the <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/"
						target="_blank">Institute for System Software</a> about a "<em>LALR(1) Parser Table
						Generator</em>". The goal was to create a tool that is able to generate parser tables for a
					specified grammar. This tool allows lecturers to iterate over homework examples much faster than by
					hand.<br>
					The written thesis is available on <a href="assets/files/university/LALR1_Table_Generator.pdf"
						target="_blank">here</a>.

			<div class="education-item">
				<h3>Elektronik und Technische Informatik - Mobile Computing & Software Engineering</h3>
				<p>HTL Braunau</p>
				<p>September 2015 - June 2020</p>
				<p>
					As a start into my education, I attended the HTL in Braunau am Inn. The focus was on electronics and
					computer engineering, with the specialization in mobile computing and software engineering. There, I
					got basics in electronics and also programming.
					<br>
					One of the highlights was the Maturaarbeit, where I worked in a project in cooperation with the <a
						href="https://www.jku.at/en/lit-artificial-intelligence-lab/" target="_blank">Artificial
						Intelligence Lab</a>. The project was about "<em>Autonomous Car Mapping and Tracking</em>",
					where we tried to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping"
						target="_blank">SLAM</a> algorithms working on a small Audi self-driving car.
					<br>
					The written Maturaarbeit is available on <a
