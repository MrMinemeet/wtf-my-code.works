				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a software engineer driven by passion for programming and constant curiosity to learn. Beyond coding, I enjoy the challenge of strategy games. Furthermore, I like to experiment in the kitchen and try out new recipes. When I'm not coding or cooking, I enjoy spending time with friends and family.
				</p>
				<p>
					My technical path started at <a href="https://htl-braunau.at/" target="_blank">HTL-Braunau</a>, where I focused on Electronics with a specialization on <em>Mobile Computing & Software Engineering</em>. This sparked my interest and led me to pursue a <em>Computer Science</em> Bachelor's degree at <a href="https://jku.at" target="_blank">JKU</a>. While studying, I enjoyed sharing some knowledge by working as a tutor for the <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/" target="_blank">Institute of System Software</a> (SSW) for six semesters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Somewhat recently, I finished my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in <em>Software Engineering</em> at JKU. During my studies I had the opportunity to work as a part-time Software Engineer at <a href="https://dynatrace.com" target="_blank">Dynatrace</a>, where I contributed to the <em>OneAgent Node.js</em> team. My Master's thesis, "<em>A Generic Machine Code Instrumentation Library</em>", was a challenging project I have been undertaking in collaboration with both the SSW and Dynatrace.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the educational steps done, I continue to work in the OneAgent Node.js team at Dynatrace in a full-time position. My focus is on enhancing the Node.js OneAgent by adding new features, as well as improving and maintaining the existing agent.

					<h3>Computer Science Master<br><small>Software Engineering</small></h3>
					<p>Johannes Kepler University Linz</p>
					<p class="date">February 2024 - July 2025</p>
					<p>
						The main focus is on my Master's thesis about creating "<em>A Generic Machine Code Instrumentation Library</em>". This project is a collaboration between the SSW and Dynatrace. In contrast to other tools which only support certain architectures or operating systems, this library aims to be written in a modular way, such that multi-architecture and multi-operating system support can be achieved.<br>
						The written thesis is available on <a class="download" target="_blank" href="assets/files/university/A_Generic_Machine_Code_Instrumentation_Library.pdf">here</a>.

					<h3>Computer Science Bachelor</h3>
					<p>Johannes Kepler University Linz</p>
					<p class="date">October 2020 - January 2024</p>
					<p>
						The adventure of my studies then started at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz with the Bachlor's program in Computer Science. There I got a broader understanding of the field of computer science. I learned about various concepts, algorithms, and programming languages. I also got a deeper understanding of the software development process and the importance of testing and debugging.<br>
						One of the highlights was the "Compiler Construction" course, where the task is to create a compiler in Java for the <em>MicroJava</em> language. This was a challenging but also rewarding
						experience, when I saw the first program running and all the components working together nicely (and also seeing all tests pass was a great feeling).<br>
						Related to this course, I wrote my Bachelor's thesis at the SSW about a "<em>LALR(1) Parser Table Generator</em>". The goal was to create a tool that is able to generate parser tables for a specified grammar. This tool allows lecturers to iterate over homework examples much faster than by hand.<br>
						The written thesis is available on <a class="download" target="_blank" href="assets/files/university/LALR1_Table_Generator.pdf">here</a>.

					<p>
						As a start into my software-related education, I attended the HTL in Braunau am Inn. The focus was on electronics and computer engineering, with the specialization in mobile computing and software engineering. There, I got basics in electronics and also programming.<br>
						One of the highlights was the Maturaarbeit, where I worked in a project in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/lit-artificial-intelligence-lab/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>. The project was about "<em>Autonomous Car Mapping and Tracking</em>", where we tried to get <em>SLAM</em> algorithms working on a small Audi self-driving car.<br>
